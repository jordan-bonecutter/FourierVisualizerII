# FourierVisualizerII
A rewritten version of my Fourier transform visualizer, now in Python! It also takes SVG files as input!

Running the program is pretty simple (I'll probably add some more opts in the future). 
Just python3 ./main.py <input.svg> <output.avi>
... and BAM! That easy. 
For now you can change framerate, video size, and other options at the top of the main.py file.

Also, this requires my pyxml module, which can be found on my github repos.
